## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This file is for practice.

  Table Header | Second Header
  -------------|--------------
  Table cell 1 | Table cell 2
  Cell 3       | Cell 4

Practice with inline code  
Two plus two equals `r 2 + 2`.  

This is me starting a chunk of code:  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
x = 4  
y = x+2
print(y)
```
